# OLEDimage.py

# Meant for use with the Raspberry Pi and an Adafruit monochrome OLED display!

# This program takes any image (recommended: landscape) and converts it into a black and white image which is then 
# displayed on one of Adafruit's monochrome OLED displays. 

# To run the code simply change directory to where it is saved and then type: sudo python OLEDimage.py <image name>
# For example: sudo python OLEDimage.py penguins.jpg 
# The image penguins.jpg is included in this repo as an example! Download any image that you want and simple change the
# image name!

# This program was created by The Raspberry Pi Guy
